        <h2>History</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>More than 50 years ago, the legendary French chansonnier Gilbert Bécaud performed in Moscow. When he returned
            to
            Paris he wrote the song “Natalie” and dedicated it to his Russian guide. The song goes: “We are walking
            around
            Moscow, visiting Red Square, and you are telling me learned things about Lenin and the Revolution, but I’m
            thinking, ‘I wish we were at Café Pushkin, looking at the snow outside the windows. We’d drink hot
            chocolate,
            and talk about something completely different…’”</p>

        <p>The song became incredibly popular in France, and it is no wonder that French visitors to Moscow tried to
            find
            “Café Pushkin.” They couldn’t find it as it existed only as a poetic fantasy in Bécaud’s song. But it was
            the
            song that inspired Andrei Dellos, an artist and restaurateur with Franco-Russian roots, to create “Café
            Pushkin.”
            On June 4, 1999, “Café Pushkin” opened in a Baroque mansion on Tverskoy Boulevard. At the grand opening,
            Gilbert
            Bécaud performed his world-famous song “Natalie.”</p>
        <p>Tverskoy Boulevard and the streets around it played a significant, almost mystical role in the life of
            Russian
            poet Alexander Pushkin. When the boulevard opened in 1796, it became a favorite place among Moscow high
            society
            for a stroll. Pushkin could be found there frequently.</p>
        <p>The famous dancing master Jogel, who taught dance to the children of Moscow and St Petersburg’s nobility for
            many
            years, hosted children’s balls at the house of the Kologrivov family, which stood where the Moscow Gorky
            Arts
            Theatre now stands. It was at one such ball that Pushkin met his future wife, Natalya Goncharova. At the far
            end
            of the boulevard, near the Nikitsky Gates, is the church where the couple later married. The statue of
            Pushkin
            originally stood on Tverskoy Boulevard, too.</p>
        <h2>The Restaurant legend</h2>
        <p>Café Pushkin is one of Moscow’s legends. The restaurant opened on June 4, 1999 – although many people are
            sure it
            has always been there.
            In the 1780s, a St. Petersburg nobleman in the service of Empress Catherine the Great retired from the Royal
            Household and moved to Moscow. There he decided to build a house and invited architects from Italy.
            Well-versed
            in Russian taste and with a keenly honed feeling for Muscovite architectural style, the Italians built a
            baronial Baroque mansion a la russe. Baroque details run throughout the interiors of the building. The house
            passed to a German aristocrat in the middle of the 19th century as part of his future wife’s dowry. Yet
            financial ruin forced the new owner to open a pharmacy in the building. To this end, the building was
            replanned.
